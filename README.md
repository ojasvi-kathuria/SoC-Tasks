Checkpoint 1 (11th April 2021)

Task 1(A1)
During this we learned basic stuff about python and its libraries such as pandas, numpy. This was a exercise in which we leart how to import libraries and extract information from a dataset using these libraries.

Task 2 (A2)
This was a Matplotlib exercise. We learnt how can we plot graph and deduce statistical conclusions about any dataset. 

The practice notebooks of the 2 tasks have been attached  [Task 1](https://github.com/ojasvi-kathuria/SoC-Tasks/blob/main/Task_1(A1).ipynb)

Checkpoint 2 (8th June 2021)

During the phase 2 of our project, we learned about neural network snd deep learning.
We saw open cv and explored how images can be manipulated using the same. In a mini project , we made [live sketch maker](https://github.com/ojasvi-kathuria/SoC-Tasks/blob/main/Live%20Sketch%20Using%20Webcam.ipynb) We also learned about machine learning, the principles behind it and for practice we did an basic identifying handwritten digit recognition project and a recognition project of cats vs dogs. 

Task 4(B3)
This was a simple: Age and Gender Detector Program. This captured live image and we used the pre trained model deep learning model to accomplish the task.

Task 5(B4)
This was a similar task as earlier , the difference lied in the input video. Unlike the above task here we applied the age and gender detector on youtube videos and get the ouput videos in a drive folder we gave in the output directory.

Checkpoint 3 (18th July 2021)

Task 6(C1)
This was an introduction to make android apps using tensorflowLite. We made an app for live age and gender detection using Android Studio 
The resources used for the task are here [Task 6](https://github.com/ojasvi-kathuria/SoC-Tasks/blob/main/Task_6(C1).ipynb)

Task 7(C2)
This was our final goal. We developed a Face Recognition App capable of detecting all faces in the image and a video, cropping all faces and extracting their faces and clustering the similar faces together. After the similar faces are recognised, we can rename them and tag people in the pics.
